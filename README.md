## Food Classifier with EfficientNet
This project is a state-of-the-art food classifier that utilizes the power of the EfficientNet neural network architecture.
The food classifier utilizes transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained EfficientNet model.

## Key Features:
EfficientNet Neural Network: The classifier employs the EfficientNet architecture, which is known for its excellent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Food-101 Dataset: The model has been trained on the Food-101 dataset, which contains 101 food categories with a total of 101,000 images. 

Accuracy: The model has achieved 80% accuracy on the test data set. 

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the food classifier has been evaluated using a separate test set from the Food-101 dataset. The evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrate the classifier's reliability in making accurate predictions.
